==== How to Test ? ====

* Test with simple cases, using hard coded solutions
** @my\_sum([1,2,3]) == 6@

* Test special or boundary cases
** @my\_sum([]) == 0@

* Test that meaningful error messages are raised upon corrupt input
** @my\_sum(['1', 'a'])@ 
** --> @TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'@

==== Stuff That's Harder to Test ====

Probabilistic code
* Use toy examples as validation
* Consider fixing the seed for your pseudo random number generator

Hardware
* use mock up software that behaves like the hardware should

Plots
* (any creative ideas welcome)
